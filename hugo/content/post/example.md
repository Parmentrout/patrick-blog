Hey! Welcome to my software blog! I'm _Patrick Armentrout_, a software engineer from Denver, CO.

I'm going to use this blog to publish random findings and fun things I find in web development frameworks. In particular I'll put up a lot of Angular-specific posts, and maybe a few ridiculous ones as well.

Thanks for checking out the site and subscribe or check back for new articles posted every month!

Cheers,
Patrick

Hugo also offers powerful support for code snippets:

    import "fmt"
    func print_hi(name string) {
      fmt.Println("Hi, ", name)
    }

    func main() {
      print_hi("Tom")
    }
    //=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
