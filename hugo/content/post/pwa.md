# About

Before we get started what is a PWA (Progressive Web App)? Originally invented by Google in 2015, a PWA is a set of WC3 standards that allows a web application to behave like a mobile application. If you're ever browsing on your phone and you see that popup, "Do you want to add to your home screen?", this is technically a PWA. When you click on it, an icon is added to your phone.

Here is a full list of PWA behavior:

Progressive to work for every user/browser

- Responsive / mobile first design
- “Add to home screen” feature allows for users to add to their app library
- Ability to work offline or over slow connections using service workers
- Manifest file to control the mobile user experience
- Icons, splash screen, name, theming, etc..
- Ability to send push notifications
- Easily discoverable by search engines due to manifest and service worker registration scope
- Ability to interact with phone hardware

If you're reading this on a phone or tablet right now and asking yourself, "Wait a second, why isn't his blog website PWA enabled!?". The answer is because I'm lazy ;), but I will add it in a future release.
